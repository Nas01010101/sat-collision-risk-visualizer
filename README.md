# sat-collision-risk-visualizer

A full-stack tool for visualizing and predicting satellite collision risk.

## Features (In progress)

- ML model predicts collision risk using miss distance, time to closest approach, and relative speed.
- Flask backend serves TLE data and risk predictions via REST API.
- React frontend with CesiumJS displays satellites and debris on a 3D globe, color-coded by risk.
